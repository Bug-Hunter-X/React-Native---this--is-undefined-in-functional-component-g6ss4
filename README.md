# React Native: 'this' is undefined in Functional Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: attempting to access the `this` keyword inside a functional component.  Functional components in React do not have a `this` context in the same way that class components do.  This example shows the error and provides a solution.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app using your preferred React Native method (e.g., `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`).
4. Observe the error in the console.

## Solution

The solution is to avoid using `this` within functional components. Instead, use functional component features like hooks or closures to manage state and behavior.
